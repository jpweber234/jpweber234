# Joe Weber

Systems Engineer with two years of experience in software verification and validation, automated testing, and requirements management interested in changing careers to software engineering. I hold a Bacheloer's Degree in Electrical Engineering from UMass Amherst, where I focused on integrated circuit design and semiconductor devices and fabrication.

I began learning to program in late 2019 and am using this account as a portfolio for the projects I have worked on. In the future, I plan to develop my automated testing knowledge and find a position in a software developer or test automation role.

Primary Languages: Python, C++
